Prowler is a Bash script that uses curl to download and display the contents of robots.txt from a specified URL. It can also fetch and display the contents of a specified file path.

## Description

Prowler is a versatile Bash script designed for web reconnaissance. With a focus on simplicity and effectiveness, it fetches and analyzes robots.txt files from target websites. The tool displays the contents of robots.txt, highlighting specific patterns to quickly identify disallowed paths, allowed paths, and more. Optionally, Prowler can fetch and display the content of specified files. A user-friendly and efficient choice for initial website analysis.

## Clone Project
git clone https://github.com/your-username/prowler.git

## Usage
Example 1: Display robots.txt content from a URL
./prowler.sh http://example.com

Example 2: Display robots.txt content and a specific file from a URL./prowler.sh http://example.com example_file.txt

Example 3: Display help message

## Parameters

-Url(htp://example.com): Specifies the target URL. The script fetches the robots.txt

-File_Path(Optional): If provided, the script retrieves

## Known Issues

1. **Output Formatting**: In certain cases, the output formatting may not display correctly on terminals with limited color support or specific configurations. We are actively working on improving the compatibility for a broader range of environments.

2. **URL Handling**: The script may encounter issues when handling URLs with special characters or unconventional formats. We recommend using URL encoding for such cases until a comprehensive fix is implemented.

3. **Verbose Mode Quirks**: Users might experience unexpected behavior when using the `--verbose` option in specific scenarios. We are investigating reported cases and will address these quirks in future updates.
